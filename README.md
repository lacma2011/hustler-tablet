# hustler-tablet
Singe Page Application I did for Hustler (Adult site) in 2013 using jquery and a designer's jquery mobile pages.
It had multi-site content as well as division of content by categories.

The site no longer exists but used to be at: tour.tablet.hustler.com (you can check the waybackmachine at search archive.org, though API is not functional there)

On this source, I have mocked the API with random data so this will work but without showing actual data and media files (video scenes, photos, etc). Mocks and additional support functions are done in /lib/

For an example run see: http://tour.tablet.hustler.runwaypassport.com/

Note that some design icons are missing and there may be other bugs I did not fix from this site transfer.
